# NCU NexCypherUltra
Weâ€™ve been building something called NexCypher Ultraâ„¢â€”a modular encryption system designed for secure logic, stealth vaults, and symbolic control.
Itâ€™s still in development, but Weâ€™ve got a version ready for testing.
If youâ€™re into ciphers, UI design, or challenge modes, Weâ€™d love your feedback.
