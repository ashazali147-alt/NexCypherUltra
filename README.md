# NCU NexCypherUltra
Iâ€™ve been building something called NexCypher Ultraâ„¢â€”a modular encryption system designed for secure logic, stealth vaults, and symbolic control.
Itâ€™s still in development, but Iâ€™ve got a demo version ready for testing.
If youâ€™re into ciphers, UI design, or challenge modes, Iâ€™d love your feedback.
DM me or drop a ðŸ”’ if you want early access.
